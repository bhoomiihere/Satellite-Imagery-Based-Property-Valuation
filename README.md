# Satellite Imagery Based Property Valuation

##  Overview
This project builds a multimodal regression pipeline to predict property prices using:
1. Tabular housing attributes
2. Satellite imagery fetched using geographic coordinates

The objective is to enhance traditional valuation models by incorporating visual environmental context.
